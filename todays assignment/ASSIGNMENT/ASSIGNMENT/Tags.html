    </h3>
    <p>Ar-Rahman[1] (Arabic: ٱلرَّحْمَانِ, ar-raḥmān; meaning: The Merciful;[2] Most Gracious;[3] Most Merciful [4]) is
        the 55th Chapter (Surah) of the Qur'an, with 78 verses (āyāt). The Surah revealed in Mecca, it emphasizes themes
        of mercy, creation, and the relationship between Allah and humanity, making it a significant chapter in Islamic
        teachings. [5]

        The title of the surah, Ar-Rahman, appears in verse 1 and means "The Most Beneficent". The divine appellation
        "ar-Rahman" also appears in the opening formula which precedes every surah except Sura 9 ("In the Name of God,
        the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy"). English translations of the surah's title include "The Most
        Gracious",[6] "The All Merciful",[7] "The Lord of Mercy",[8] "The Beneficent", and "The Mercy-Giving".
        In the fourth century CE south Arabian pagan inscriptions started to be replaced by monotheistic expressions,
        using the term rahmān.[9]</p>
